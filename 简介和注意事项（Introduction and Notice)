本代码基本思想来自于《Semi-supervised Linear Discriminant Clustering》（Chien-Liang Liu，Wen-Hoar Hsaio, Chia-Hoang Lee, and Fu-Sheng Gou，《IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics》，( Volume: 44, Issue: 7, July 2014)）
本代码主要是基于论文中提出的半监督学习方法，加上视觉词袋模型技术，将论文中在文本分类上的作用拓展到了人脸识别上，并且基于AR,ORL和Yale数据集进行了正确率测试
本代码只是作者在大学机器学习课的一个报告，有很多的疏漏未尽之处，敬请谅解。
The basic idea of this code is derived from "Semi-supervised Linear Discriminant Clustering" (Chien-Liang Liu, Wen-Hoar Hsaio, Chia-Hoang Lee, and Fu-Sheng Gou, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, ( Volume: 44, Issue: 7, July 2014)）
This code is mainly based on the semi-supervised learning method proposed in the paper, coupled with the visual bag-of-words model technology, which extends the role of text classification in the paper to face recognition, and the accuracy test is carried out based on AR, ORL and Yale datasets
This code is just a report of the author in a college machine learning class, and there are many omissions and unfinished points,thanks for your understanding.
